# The Pig Game
### A web application built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## Game rules
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if any of the die rolls 1 OR both of the dice roll 6, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.

### Best of luck!
